# docker-mininet
simulation network applications using docker and mininet


1. Install Docker.
Ref: https://docs.docker.com/install/

2. Install Mininet
Ref: http://mininet.org/download

3. Install docker-package for python
  $ sudo pip install docker
  
4. Configure docker-Mininet
  4.1 Replace “~/mininet/mininet/util.py” by our own “util.py”.
      For “util.py”, we just modified the API-function “makeIntfPair”.
  4.2 Run “cd ~/mininet” to change into mininet directory.
  4.3 Then run “sudo make install” to make the modification effective.
  4.4 Copy our docker-mininet API file “dockernode.py” into the work directory. 
      Then enjoy simulations by using python script. Example codes are attached in the Appendix.

Appendix

*docker-test.py is a simple example to run docker applications over network created by mininet

*docker-daml.py is to run distributed machine learning over network created by mininet
